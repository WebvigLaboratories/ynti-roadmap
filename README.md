# Project YNTI public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official YNTI public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/WebvigLaboratories/projects/1)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [Project YNTI public feedback discussions](https://github.com/WebvigLaboratories/ynti-roadmap/discussions). 

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases. 

- A **feature** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://TBD/) post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha:** *Primarily for testing and feedback*\
Limited availability. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta:** *Publicly available in full or limited capacity*\
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Release phases - For Project YNTI

Some features may be marked with a YNTI 1.X label, which indicates that the feature will also become available for YNTI customers. Below are the release version numbers and expected release quarters (_Note: these dates are subject to change_). 

**YNTI release version dates**:
| **Version Number** | **Release Quarter** | **Release Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 1.0 | Q1 2023 | [Release Notes](https://TBD) |
| 1.1 | Q2 2023 | - |
| 1.2 | Q3 2023 | - |
| 1.3 | Q4 2024 | - |

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

Project YNTI is continually releasing new/updated features. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information.

## Feature

The following is a list of our current features and products, with distinct labels for filtering:

- **portfolio:** YNTI Portfolio Management
- **analysis:** YNTI Business Analysis Tools
- **experiments:** YNTI Experiment Management
- **insights:** YNTI Insights
- **infrastructure:** YNTI Infrastructure

_More labels will be added in the future as needed._
